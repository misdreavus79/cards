# cards
Popular Memory game, recreated and repurposed into a level-based game. 
Game play has four main formats: Freestyle, Timed, Moves, and Scored. More formats to come.
Powerups feature allow you to make the game easier as the levels increase.
There are two branches, master and cards_table. The cards_table branch sets up the board inside a table, so that if one chooses to remove the cards upon successful matches, the rest of the cards stay in place.
Code is self-explanatory, but feel free to ask any questions.
